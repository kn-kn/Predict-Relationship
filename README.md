## Evaluating Machine Learning Models to Predict the Relationship Status of High School Students

This small project focuses on popular machine learning models in determining the relationship status of high school students.
Our analysis will utilize the following techniques in particular:

    Train/ test splitting VS. K-folds cross-validation
    Logistic Regression and K-Nearest-Neighbours
    Confusion Matrix
    ROC Curves and AUC (limited)

The dataset consists of 395 observations of high school students in Portugal with various attributes describing each students' current situation.
